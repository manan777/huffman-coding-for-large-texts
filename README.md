# huffman-coding-for-large-texts
Huffman coding is based on the frequency of occurrences of a data item.  Huffman coding assigns codes to characters such that the length of the code depends on the relative frequency or weight of the corresponding character. Thus, it is a variable-length code. The principle is to use a lower number of bits to encode the data that occurs more frequently.
